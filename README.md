# DigitalArt Marketplace

## Project Description

DigitalArt Marketplace is a creator-first NFT platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The platform prioritizes artist welfare by implementing significantly reduced marketplace fees (2% vs industry standard 5-10%) and enhanced artist protection features including automatic royalty distribution on secondary sales.

The marketplace enables digital artists to mint, list, and sell their artwork as NFTs while ensuring they receive fair compensation through built-in royalty mechanisms that protect their intellectual property rights across all future transactions.
